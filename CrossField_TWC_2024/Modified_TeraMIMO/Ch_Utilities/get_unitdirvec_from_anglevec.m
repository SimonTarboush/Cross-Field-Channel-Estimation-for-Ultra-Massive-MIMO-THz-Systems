% This function converts the angles (AoD/AoA) vector to unit direction vector
% The other models are implemented in the original code of TeraMIMO

% Input Arguments:
% AngleVec: Angles vector contains [phi (azimuth); theta (elevation)] (Rad) (phi (azimuth) range is (-pi,pi], theta (elevation) range is [0,pi])
% Output Arguments:
% UnitDirVec: Unit direction vector
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function UnitDirVec = get_unitdirvec_from_anglevec(AngleVec)
% This conversion is the same as Eq. (13) in TeraMIMO TVT
phi = AngleVec(1);
theta = AngleVec(2);
UnitDirVec = [cos(phi)*sin(theta); sin(phi)*sin(theta); cos(theta)];
