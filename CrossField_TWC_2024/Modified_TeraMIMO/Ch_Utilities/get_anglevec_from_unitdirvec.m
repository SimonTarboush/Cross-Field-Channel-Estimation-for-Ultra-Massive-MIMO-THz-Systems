% This function converts the unit direction vector to angles vector (AoD/AoA)
% The other models are implemented in the original code of TeraMIMO

% Input Arguments:
% UnitDirVec: Unit direction vector
% Output Arguments:
% AngleVec: Angles vector contains [phi (azimuth); theta (elevation)] (Rad) (phi (azimuth) range is (-pi,pi], theta (elevation) range is [0,pi])
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function AngleVec = get_anglevec_from_unitdirvec(UnitDirVec)
% This conversion is the same as Eq. (14) in TeraMIMO TVT
AngleVec = zeros(2,1);
AngleVec(1) = atan2(UnitDirVec(2,:), UnitDirVec(1,:));
AngleVec(2) = acos(UnitDirVec(3,:));
